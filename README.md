# Allergies Mod by Kid Koder
 *__1 in 13__ children have food allergies*. *And __1 in 12__ kids have athsma*. Oh, and don't forget sesonal allergies!
 
 ## Help educate the world about allergies and asthma. ##
Only a certain hanful of people have __allergies__ and/or __athsma__. And that means everyone else doesn't know what it is like. I have even heard stories that people get __bullied__ about it. 

## How it works ##
When you create a new world, the mod automaticly assigns you __allergies__, along with serverity, if you have __athsma__ and/or seasonal __allergies__. This mod adds *Allergy Shots(Epinephrine), Allergy Pills(Diphenhydramine), BOTH types of inhallers, and allergy testing.*
